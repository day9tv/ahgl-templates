    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The After Hours Gaming League is a fun, modern twist to the traditional corporate sports league. Instead of softball or basketball, the AHGL offers corporate teams the chance for some friendly competition on the virtual battlefields of top strategy games. The AHGL is also a fundraiser for charity: corporate teams compete for the chance to donate the $5,000 top cash prize to the charity of their choice.</p>
    <p>Season One of the AHGL saw eight high-tech giants—Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Yelp and Zynga—duke it out on the battlefields of StarCraft II. The tournament Grand Finals were held on the Facebook campus in Palo Alto, California, and broadcast live over Day[9]TV to an audience of over 100,000 live viewers. In an exciting victory, Microsoft won the day for its charity, Amnesty International.</p>

  <h1>What are eSports?</h1>
  <p>eSports, or electronic sports, is a term used to describe computer games which are played competitively and enjoyed by crowds of cheering spectators—just like real sports! eSports have become a cultural phenomenon in the last five years, featuring televised broadcasts, crowded tournament arenas, and “cyber-athlete stars.”</p>
  <p>StarCraft and League of Legends are two of the most popular and closely followed eSports games with many top players and professional tournaments offering millions of dollars in prize pools each year.</p>
  <section id="starcraft">
    <h1>What is StarCraft?</h1>
    <p>StarCraft is a real time strategy game first released in 1998 by Blizzard Entertainment. It has become one of the most popular and enduring computer games ever published. StarCraft has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and has gained a cult following among its gamers. In 2010, Blizzard released Starcraft II and that sequel immediately became the game of the year, selling more than 3 million copies in the first month of its release.</p>
    <p>Unlike other games, which are played, won and discarded, StarCraft, with its carefully balanced elements of risk, strategy and action, continues to intrigue and engage players. Often considered a fast paced and modern equivalent of chess, StarCraft and StarCraft II require speed, dexterity, split focus and an encyclopedic knowledge of tactical strategy. StarCraft II enjoys an almost cult-like following among its fans and has given birth to a robust competitive gaming scene.</p>
    <p>Starcraft II is equally enjoyed by non-players, for whom it has become a popular spectator sport (“eSport”) with professional gaming leagues competing for top prize money.</p>
